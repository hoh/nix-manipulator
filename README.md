A python library and tool powerful enough to be used into IPython solely that intent to make the 
process of writing code that modify Nix source code as easy and as simple as possible. 

That includes writing custom refactoring, generic refactoring, tools, IDE or directly modifying 
your Nix source code via IPython with a higher and more powerful abstraction than the advanced text modification
tools that you find in advanced text editors and IDE.

This project guarantees you that it will only modify your code where you ask him to. 
To achieve this, it is based on tree-sitter, a multilingual AST.
